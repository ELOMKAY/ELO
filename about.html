            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Biosphere is a community-driven organization based in Dundalk, Ireland, dedicated to making our planet greener through better recycling practices and the use of sustainable alternatives, such as bioplastics.</p>

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>We believe that the future of our planet depends on the actions we take today. Our main goals are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Educating communities on how to recycle properly.</li>
                <li>Promoting the adoption of bioplastics as an eco-friendly alternative to traditional plastics.</li>
                <li>Reducing waste and conserving natural resources.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Our Approach</h3>
            <p>We work with local schools, businesses, and households to provide workshops and resources that teach proper recycling habits and highlight the importance of using bioplastics. Additionally, we produce and distribute bioplastics that replace harmful materials.</p>

            <p>Our ultimate goal is to create a world where sustainability is at the core of everything we do, from the products we use to the way we live our lives.</p>
